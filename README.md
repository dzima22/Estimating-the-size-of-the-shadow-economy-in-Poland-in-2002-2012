-The chart depicts the actual GDP  alongside GDP predictions from two models:Model I and Model II for Poland from 2002 to 2012.
-The models closely follow the actual GDP trend, though Model II shows more significant deviations, particularly between 2007 and 2009. These discrepancies highlight the varying accuracy and potential limitations of the models used for estimating the shadow economy's impact on GDP

-The chart above compares the percentage share of the shadow economy in Poland as estimated by three different sources: GUS (Central Statistical Office of Poland), EY (Ernst & Young), and the own research.
-The research method suggests higher volatility and sensitivity to economic conditions, whereas GUS and EY provide more stable and consistent estimates over the period. This indicates potential differences in methodologies and data sources used by the different estimators.
